Note - Solution for exercise-2 is in "AllocationEngine.DoBetterAllocation()" . This also will by-default apply the basic algo of exercise-1 in case it does not find any drivers who are available within the preparation time. Pls. refer Main()  in Program.cs for the test entry points and to follow the flow.
